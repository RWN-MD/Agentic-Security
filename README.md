# Agentic Security

## Introduction
The **Agentic Security** repository is a critical pillar of the [Agentic Network](https://github.com/RWN-MD/Agentic-Network.git) project, aimed at ensuring the safety and integrity of the `.agent` ecosystem. This repository focuses on building robust security frameworks to protect `.agent` domains and the agents that interact within this namespace.

## Purpose
Security is at the heart of the `.agent` TLD. The **Agentic Security** repository focuses on:
- Verifying that only authorized agents can access `.agent` domains.
- Providing secure communication channels between agents.
- Implementing safeguards against misuse and malicious activities.

## Features
1. **Agent Authentication Protocols:** Tools to verify the legitimacy of agents accessing `.agent` resources.
2. **Encryption Mechanisms:** Secure protocols for agent-to-agent communication.
3. **Threat Mitigation:** Protection against DDoS attacks, unauthorized access, and other vulnerabilities.
4. **Ethical Safeguards:** Systems to enforce ethical usage of `.agent` domains.

## Structure
- **`/auth`**: Authentication and verification tools.
- **`/encryption`**: Secure communication protocols.
- **`/docs`**: Technical documentation and security guidelines.
